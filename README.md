## Running Locally

There are two ways you can run the ARK Paperwallet locally:

1. Download the latest `dist.zip` release, extract the contents and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Clone the repo, install the requirements and dependencies and run `yarn serve` to run a local version.

## Adding Networks

By default, the ARK Paper Wallet uses the ARK mainnet when generating a wallet.
However, it comes bundles with multiple network options that you can switch to, making it usable on for example devnet and bridgechains.
If you run a public bridgechain, you can have your network added by creating a PR that adds the `name`, `pubkeyHash` and `WIF` to the existing list of networks.

## Using Custom Network

If the network you want to use is not listed in the dropdown, you can switch to custom networks in the modal, fill in the `pubkeyHash` and `WIF` values of the network you want to use, and press `Save` to apply it. That's it!
